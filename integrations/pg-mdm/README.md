# pg-mdm stewardship adapter

The v0.47 package is a read-only policy layer over the approved
`MDM-STEWARDSHIP/1` projection. It validates an authorized case relation,
publishes immutable React-owned policy revisions, and exposes deterministic
routing, elapsed-time deadline, and fixed-population comparison reads. The
additive v0.48 worker package submits reviewed queue, due-date, and escalation
intents through pg-react's existing episode transaction.

The v0.47 read path never writes an MDM relation, calls `submit_policy_intent`,
creates React work, advances a lifecycle frontier, or invokes a refresh. The
v0.48 worker writes only through `mdm_steward.submit_policy_intent`; MDM remains
the authority for each action. Live v0.47 qualification passed against pg-mdm
v0.13.1 (extension version 0.14.0), which provides
`mdm_steward.policy_cases_v1`; fixture qualification uses a separate schema.
Support is limited to the approved 100-case pilot envelope. Production-scale
resource and recovery limits remain unsupported; see the
[v0.47.0 release notes](../../docs/v0.47.0-release-notes.md).

The public seams are:

- `pgreact_mdm.validate_inputs(source_relation)` and
  `pgreact_mdm.policy_inputs(source_relation)` for the authorized projection.
- `pgreact_mdm.publish_package(policy_revision, package)` for immutable package
  publication and `pgreact_mdm.policy_document(policy_revision)` for review.
- `pgreact_mdm.route_cases(source_relation, policy_revision[, entity_name])`
  for winner, ambiguity, no-candidate, protection, and no-op explanations.
- `pgreact_mdm.deadline_preview(source_relation, policy_revision, captured_at[, entity_name])`
  for explicit-time deadline proposals.
- `pgreact_mdm.compare_population(...)` for complete or partial bounded
  comparisons with an explicit coverage manifest.

After the core extension is installed, load `typed-flow.sql` and pass the
returned `pgreact_api.declaration` to `pgreact.validate`, `pgreact.preview`,
`pgreact.review_token`, and `pgreact.compare`. The bridge adds the signed MDM
source as a typed policy support relation. The typed version includes the
published package digest, so route or deadline changes require a new revision
and declaration review. It does not deploy or run the declaration.
Run `tests/integrations/pg-mdm/v0.47-typed.sql` after the fixture test in a
database with the core extension installed to check that identity.

For v0.48, publish a canonical intent package with
`pgreact_mdm.publish_intent_package(policy_revision, package)`. Run
`pgreact_mdm.intent_declaration`, review its preview, then deploy it through
`pgreact.deploy` before creating any binding. pg-react checks that the runner
owns the candidate views and callback functions. After installing the adapter,
a DBA grants `pgreact_mdm_worker` to a non-superuser runner login with
`SET TRUE, INHERIT FALSE`, then calls
`pgreact_mdm.configure_intent_deployer(login_role)`. The runner must have no
membership in the MDM helper or entity execution roles. pg-react also needs its
login to read `mdm_steward.policy_cases_v1` when it creates the evaluation stream;
it receives no MDM binding or receipt access. The selected NOLOGIN worker reads
only the authorized case projection. The runner owns the intent views and
callbacks, which invoke the worker-owned submission function. After deploying
the three rules, call `configure_intent_deployer(login_role)` again; this leaves
rule review and refresh owned by the runner and assigns the generated episode
dispatchers to the worker.

After deployment, the entity execution role creates or replaces a binding with
`pgreact_mdm.create_intent_binding` or
`pgreact_mdm.replace_intent_binding`. Grant that role `USAGE` on `pgreact_mdm`
so it can call these adapter routines. Each operation activates or reconciles
the MDM binding and makes its local runtime eligible. The runner then calls
`pgreact_mdm.sync_intent_case_identities()` and refreshes the three rules before
processing episodes. Run `pgreact_mdm.execute_intent_episode` with the runner
session set to `pgreact_mdm_worker`; refresh rules as the runner because pg-react
checks rule ownership. The adapter stores a stable bigint identity for each
entity and case pair because MDM case keys are entity-scoped. Run the sync
before refresh whenever MDM may have new cases. After a restore, the entity
execution role must call
`pgreact_mdm.reconcile_intent_binding(binding_id, 0)` before the runner syncs
identities and refreshes rules. Use `pgreact_mdm.pause_intent_binding` to pause
a live binding.

The worker role is `pgreact_mdm_worker`: `NOLOGIN`, `NOSUPERUSER`,
`NOBYPASSRLS`, and `NOINHERIT`. It can read the authorized case projection and
execute `submit_policy_intent`; it has no direct access to MDM binding or
receipt tables, and no membership path to `mdm_helper_owner` or the entity
execution role. MDM rejects its calls to human decision, refresh, rebuild, and
identity APIs. The adapter helper is owned by `mdm_helper_owner` and restores
only the narrow worker grants after binding creation, replacement, or
reconciliation.

Run `tests/integrations/pg-mdm/v0.48-codec.sql` after the fixture test, then
run `tests/integrations/pg-mdm/v0.47-live-setup.sql` to create the second MDM
entity used to exercise escalation. Run
`tests/integrations/pg-mdm/v0.48-live.sql` and
`tests/integrations/pg-mdm/v0.48-security.sql` in the joint pg-mdm 0.14 /
pg-react database. The scripts expect the MDM `foundation` E2E setup, including
the non-superuser `mdm_legacy_login` and `mdm_test_login`. The live script
creates a test-only `mdm_m2_runner` login that can set only the worker role;
each entity execution role creates its own binding. Run
`tests/integrations/pg-mdm/v0.48-restore.sh` only in a disposable joint cluster;
it pauses the source binding and recreates the worker role to qualify logical
restore, stale database and role OIDs, and entity-role reconciliation. Joint
v0.48 qualification passed. The roles, digests, commands, and results are in
[the qualification evidence](../../tests/integrations/pg-mdm/evidence/v0.48.0.md).
The image carries the matching pg-mdm `configure_helper.sql`; when running the
restore script from a host checkout, set `MDM_HELPER_CONFIG` to that file so
restored MDM helpers regain their protected ownership before reconciliation.

For installed MDM M1 qualification, bootstrap the upstream image with
`/tests/e2e.sql` and `/tests/e2e_policy.sql`, then run
`tests/integrations/pg-mdm/v0.47-live-setup.sql` followed by
`tests/integrations/pg-mdm/v0.47-live.sql` in a disposable joint database.

The package is adapter-owned and optional; the core pg-react extension remains
usable without it.
